## Inspiration

We have noticed a recent increase in person-to-person walking collisions.
To combat this problem, we wanted to create a way for individuals to communicate
their intentions to other walkers to increase knowledge-sharing.

Our solution: turn-signals but for humans!

Thinking about turning left? turn-signals but for humans automatically registers
 the direction you are looking to alert other walkers of your left turn without your hands!
 So keep on walking with both hands filled, we've got signaling covered!

 We found a project which used Computer Vision to help us get started
